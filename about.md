# About IRIS FUME plugin

**InterSystems IRIS** is a complete data platform that makes it easier to build and deploy high-performance applications 
that connect medical data. InterSystems IRIS provides several libraries which implement the most popular medical standards â€“ HL7 v2, HL7 FHIR, HL7, EDI, X12 and some others. 
For each type of medical message and medical document InterSystems IRIS provides a high-performant and secured data storage. 
Finally, true medical data interoperability is provided by the IRIS standard library.

**FUME** is a FHIR conversion and transformation engine, designed to enable any data analyst to express FHIR-related data conversions in an easy, 
compact and expressive syntax. FUME allows you to focus on what you want to achieve, rather than the technical details of how 
you are going to achieve it - so you can get quality outcomes in a fraction of the time it takes with other tools, 
and most importantly - without requiring any programming knowledge or experience.
